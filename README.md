# Get Paid-to-Watch-Curated-Educational-Content
We have a Huge problem with Humanity's awakening. Most people don't want to study &amp; learn! We can solve this with incentives. Have a Library of curated content on each Community, Use Browser Mining &amp; Ads to generate revenue. Share this with users per video watched! Give them a Quiz after. Rest goes in Endowment for Copyright holder &amp; We take 11.11% "content management fee"

# Member Suggestions
Community members can suggest Content they would like to see! This is organic & human powered. Later we can train machine learning to find similar content & spider the web.
Each suggestion is reviewed by our Community managers & editorial team! We will compare similar content/videos and give the best one the highest priority. Others that are redundant or not as good go in an "Appendix" Playlist.

# Quality First Principle:
- Content only gets approved if it's the Highest quality! And information dense.
- This encourages creators to Improve & edit the content/videos, releasing new versions that more clearly explain the information!
- Entertainment value counts too! (inspire: @BranchEducation

# Benefits:
- This also lets us Spotlight great Creators! It is marketing for them, and they don't have to do or pay anything extra as our management fee covers everything.
- Users see new videos that they otherwise wouldn't see
- Everyone wins!

# Erata
This concept was inspired by "Play to Earn" Mobile games! There are so many, but they don't actually enhance your life. People play them purely to earn small amounts of money.

# We want You to become a Creator
With our "Get Paid to Watch" system, users are learning valuable information & insights about our world! They can choose any "Learning Path" they want. This will also open up the door to authorship, By inspiring people to sharre their own knowledge! We want to encourage "Watchers" to become Educators! Unlike watching which is a linear income. Becoming a Creator/Educator unlocks residual income! One can multiply their earnings by Creating, Co-Creating, & Editing content.
